## Some projects that I've worked upon

This was my final year project of engineering. It’s a raymarching based 3D engine written in C++ that allows users to create 3D scenes in a node based workflow. I am especially proud of this project as we ideated the workings of this from scratch - taking reference from research papers and other open source software to come up with a solution that is performant and implemented it with a modular and easily extensible OOPs architecture that seems pretty elegant to me. This project involves traversal of a node tree to convert the user defined graph into shader code that is used to render a 3D scene. Solving this problem and seeing it work has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life and I have been searching for a similar kind of work ever since.

**Pseudolocalization in Godot (GSoC'21)** \| [GSoC Archive](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2021/projects/4924604774088704) \| [Details](https://gist.github.com/angad-k/60a0d39882c5dff00e8b14183c96effb) \| [Code](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/51395)

As a part of Google Summer of Code'21, I worked on adding the pseudolocalization feature to Godot - an open source game engine written in C++. Pseudolocalization is a useful tool to test if products have been internationalized properly.
